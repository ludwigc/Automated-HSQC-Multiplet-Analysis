Extended data for automated analysis for multiplet identification from ultra-high resolution 2D-1H,13C-HSQC NMR spectra

This repository contains extended data and the implementation of an ICA based algorithm for automated analysis for multiplet identification and analysis of ultra-high resolution 2D-1H,13C-HSQC NMR spectra. 

The extended data pdf-file is contained in the extendedData folder.

The matlab implementation of the algorithm is contained in the matlab folder. The software is meant to be run as part of the MetaboLab software package which can be downloaded from https://www.ludwiglab.org/software-development.
